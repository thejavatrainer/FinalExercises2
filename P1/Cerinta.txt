Given a class type, return the percentage ratio between the simple properties and complex property types. Use spring-beans utilities (BeanUtils) to get information regarding the class properties (when needed).

<dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-beans</artifactId>
            <version>? </version>
</dependency>

Ex: For the attached Furniture class, the result is 75 (75% of the properties are simple (String, Boolean, etc), with the exception of the Price).
For the Chair, the result is 80, due to the extra Boolean property.

Bonus point: get the same statistic on an entire package.
