Given a parking lot that can handle both cars and busses implement logic to park a car and a bus given the following constraints:
- a car can park on any given space
- a bus can park lengthwise on any contiguous 5 spaces

Preconditions:
- the parking lot has 100 spaces
- parking spaces are grouped in 10 contiguous spaces (e.g. 1 to 10, 11 to 20 and soon)

Requirements:
- define main entities
- implement parking logic for car and buss
- unit test for parking logic

Hint :

interface Parking {
	boolean isParkingPlaceAvailable(Vehicle vehicle);
	boolean parkCar();
	boolean parkBus();
	...
	// Can be extended
}
